                <h3>FUN JUST COMES NATURAL TO US.</h3>
                <p>Whitewater Rafting Adventures is a leading rafting and adventure outfitter in the beautiful Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania. Our convenient location, just a short drive from the historic town of Jim Thorpe, has allowed us to provide unparalleled outdoor adventures on the Lehigh River for 40 years. As a family-owned and operated business, we take great pride in what we do and strive to provide our guests with the highest level of service. Our passion for the outdoors and our commitment to delivering unforgettable experiences to our guests is evident in everything we do. From rafting on class II and III rapids, to taking a leap of faith off our 900 ft long zipline, to enjoying a bike ride along the scenic Lehigh Gorge Trail, our goal is to create a memorable outdoor adventure that you’ll cherish for a lifetime.</p>
